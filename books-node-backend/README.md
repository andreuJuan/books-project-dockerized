# Books project backend

### What is the books project backend?

This project is a web service using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) in Node.js matching a RESTful API.
It provides the [books project frontend](../books-react-frontend/) with the endpoints to login, manage users and manage books.

### API endpoints

#### Authentication

`api/v1/login POST`: Used to authenticate a user. It expects to receive a `username` and `password`.
If they match with the DataBase data, it returns a JWT token valid for 1 hour.

#### Users

`api/v1/user POST`: Used to create a new user. It expects to receive a `username` and `password` that will be added in the DataBase. After that, don't forget to call the authentication endpoint.

#### Books

`api/v1/book GET`: Used to retrieve all the books in the Database. It expects to contain a valid JWToken in the header as authentication.

`api/v1/book POST`: Used to create a new book. It expects to receive a `title`, `author` and optionally a `summary`. It also expects to contain a valid JWToken in the header as authentication.

`api/v1/book PATCH`: Used to update an existing book. It expects to receive an `id` to identify the book to be updated, a `title`, `author` and optionally a `summary`. It also expects to contain a valid JWToken in the header as authentication.

`api/v1/book DELETE`: Used to delete an existing book. It expects to receive an `id` to identify the book to be deleted. It also expects to contain a valid JWToken in the header as authentication.
